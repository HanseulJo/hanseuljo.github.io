# Hanseul Cho (CV)

Hello, I am Hanseul Cho(조한슬). I am a passionate student interested in any topics that applies mathematics beyond mathematics.

Recently, I am studying the following topics with interest:
 
- Theoretical analysis of deep learning(DL), machine learning(ML)
- Expressive power of modern deep neural networks(e.g., Transformer)
- Double descent phenomenon and implicit bias/regularization
- Optimization and personalization for federated learning
- Minimax optimization for nonconvex-nonconcave function
- Matrix inequality of arithmetic and geometric means
- Neural ordinary differential equations
- Fairness in machine learning and deep learning
- (Human-AI collaboration)
- (Natural language inference/understanding)
- (Large-batch optimization)

# 👨🏻‍💻 **Research** Experience

### KAIST 2021 Post-AI research project

*(May. 2021. - Dec. 2021.)*

**Project name:** “Research on ‘AI-augmented Organizations’ of Collaborative Decision Making and Learning”

**Principal Investigator**: Sangyoon Yi (SOIL Lab, Graduate School of Future Strategy, KAIST)

**Collaborative Researcher & Advisor**: Jinkyoo Park (Systems Intelligence Lab, Industrial & Systems Engineering, KAIST)

**Contribution:** 

- *Algorithm Design*. I devised an algorithm/heuristics to find maximum point on NK landscape function (with N=6, K=1) where one must do neighbor search at a time and there is a finite horizon(max. 18 steps of search). The algorithm was used for a bunch of human-subject experiments.
- *Experimental Assistant.* I worked as an experimental assistant for 3 months.

### Algorithmic Intelligence Laboratory

***Individual study** — (Mar. 2021. - Jun. 2021.)*

**Advisor**: Jinwoo Shin (ALIN-LAB, Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI, KAIST)

**Content:** 

- Studied about gradient-based optimizers for ‘large batch training’ such as [LARS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03888) and [LAMB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00962).
- Paper review & presentation: [Why gradient clipping accelerates training: A theoretical justification for adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11881)

### Bio Imaging, Signal Processing and Learning Lab (BISPL)

***Individual study** — (Sep. 2020. - Feb. 2021.)*

**Advisor**: Jong-chul Ye (BISPL, Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST)

**Assignment:** 

- Practice: Semantic Segmentation of Kidney Tumor with 2D U-Net (KiTS19 Challenge)

### *Statistics Lab*

***Individual study** — (Mar. 2021. - Jun. 2021.)*

**Advisor**: Yeon-seung Chung (Mathematical Sciences, KAIST)

**Assignment:** 

- Read and self-studied the book “[An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7) (James, 2013)”
