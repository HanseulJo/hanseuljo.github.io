I am a Ph.D. student in the [Optimization & Machine Learning (**OptiML**) Laboratory](https://chulheeyun.github.io), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. **Chulhee "Charlie" Yun**](https://chulheeyun.github.io) at [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr) in [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) (**KAIST AI**).
Previously, I completed my M.Sc. (in AI) and B.Sc. (in Math, minor in CS, *Summa Cum Laude*) at KAIST.

🤗 Please don't hesitate to reach out for questions, discussions, and collaborations! 🤗

## 🔬 Research Interests 🔭

My primary research interests lie in **optimization, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL)**, especially focusing on both mathematical/theoretical analysis and empirical improvements (usually based on theoretical understanding).

During my journey to a Ph.D.👨🏻‍🎓, my ultimate research goal is to **rigorously understand and practically overcome** the following **three critical <red>challenges</red> in ML/DL** (see my [Thesis Proposal🔗📰](/files/PhD_thesis_research_proposal.pdf) if interested):

* <red><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> <b>[Generalizability]</b></red> **Out-of-distribution generalization of (large) language models** (e.g., length generalization and compositional generalization of Transformers)
* <red><i class="fa fa-flask"></i> <b>[Adaptability]</b></red> **Training adaptable models under evolving environments** (e.g., continual learning, maintaining the plasticity of neural networks, sample-efficient reinforcement learning)
* <red><i class="fa fa-cubes"></i> <b>[Multifacetedness]</b></red> **Learning with multiple (possibly conflicting and/or orthogonal) goals** (e.g., minimax optimization, bi‑level optimization, fairness in ML)
